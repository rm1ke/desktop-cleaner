This is a simple desktop cleaner, that will organize loose files into folders. 

It organizes based on file extension type, and if the folder exists 
for that extension type, it throws it into that folder. Shortcut is nice to periodically use 
to clean up desktop. 


Later on will add a config file option to pick what files to clean up,
currently it will just look for the following:

'.pdf', '.txt', '.rpt', '.rdl','.xls', '.xlsx', '.doc', '.docx'

I will eventually make it so that it looks for a config file in a specific location
and you can add extension types for it to look for.

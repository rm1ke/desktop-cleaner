This is a simple desktop cleaner, that will organize files into folders, based on the date they are organized, to kind of 
create an "Archive" effect. For me, I plan on having it as a shortcut, and occasionally click it to organize loose files on my work
desktop into organized folders, with dates of each "backup" essentially.

It organizes based on file extension type, and if the folder exists 
for that extension type, it throws it into that folder. Shortcut is nice to periodically use 
to clean up desktop. 


Later on will add a config file option to pick what files to clean up,
currently it will just look for the following:

'.pdf', '.txt', '.rpt', '.rdl','.xls', '.xlsx', '.doc', '.docx'

I will eventually make it so that it looks for a config file in a specific location
and you can add extension types for it to look for.

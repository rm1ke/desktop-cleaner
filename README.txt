This is a simple desktop cleaner, that will organize files into folders, based on the date they are organized, to kind of 
create an "Archive" effect. For me, I plan on having it as a shortcut, and occasionally click it to organize loose files on my work desktop into organized folders, with dates of each "backup" essentially.
 
It organizes based on file extension type, and if the folder exists 
for that extension type, it throws it into that folder. Shortcut is nice to periodically use 
to clean up desktop. 


The first time you run the .exe, it creates 'extensions.config' in the same directory the .exe is stored, if you are given the .exe and run it, it still creates the config in the same directory it was run in.

If 'extensions.config' does not exist, it will just create a file with basic extensions I chose for now: 

'.pdf', '.txt', '.rpt', '.rdl','.xls', '.xlsx', '.doc', '.docx'
